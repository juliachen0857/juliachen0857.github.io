	<BR>	There is a reason why we need to love the earth. The earth is slowly dying, and we caused that by just simply littering, letting out carbon dioxide, causing global warming, and air pollution.If we keep taking and not giving back what we take, we will use all the supply that Earth gave us, and we will have no clean food and place to live. </BR>

	<BR>	Earth is important because 73% of Earth is made of water, and it provides us oxygen to breathe and take the carbon dioxide we breathe out. The same thing with the rainforest, we are destroying the perfect environment of the ocean and the rainforests. The reason that the rainforests are very important is because it also provides us oxygen, and more supplies. There is also some rare animals living in the rainforest, so if we destroy the rainforest, the animals donâ€™t have a place to live so they die. </BR>

	<BR>	The environment is getting worse and worse! Air pollution is a major problem caused by factories, cars, burning of fossil fuels and garbages, wood fires. Factories generates harmful and poisonous gas that affects both Earth and living organisms. Car release carbon dioxide causing global warming. </BR>

	<BR>	These are the reasons that we need to love the Earth. No matter it is adults, or children, everyone have the responsibility to help make the Earth a better place for human, animals, and other living things to live. </BR>
