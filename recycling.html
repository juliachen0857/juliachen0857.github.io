<BR>Burning or throwing the waste that you created is not the best thing to get rid of trash. Not only, trash brings diseases, it also damages the atmosphere when you burn them. Instead, people can start reusing the trash by simply just recycling it. </BR>
<BR>There is a lot of benefits of you recycle, such as saving resources, saving energy, it helps protect the environment, and reduces incineration. For example, when we recycle trash, it can easily be compressed into a material. Besides, we would use that material to make products instead of using natural resources. However, if we didn’t recycle, then new products would have to be made with fresh, raw materials from Earth. Therefore, recycling helps to save raw and fresh materials from Earth. </BR>
<BR>Recycling not only saves natural resources, it also saves energy. The reason that it saves energy is that when the factories are in manufacturing process, it wouldn’t need that many natural resources, instead, use the materials that we recycled. Therefore, recycling also help saves energy. </BR>
<BR>Recycling also helps to protect the environment because when people recycle, they would pick up the trash and put it into the recycling bin. However, if people don’t recycle, then there would be trash everywhere on the ground. Besides, trash would float to the ocean, and fish would mistake the trash as if it’s their food. Moreover, we would eat those fish, and the trash would end up in our bodies, so recycle and don’t litter. </BR>
<BR>Lastly, recycle reduces incineration. Incineration is the destruction of something, which are waste materials, and burning. It reduces incineration because recycling is not burning the trash, it is compressing the trash into a material that can be replaced with natural resources. </BR></FONT>
